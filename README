 
 DS18X20 to CAN interface for Atmel AVR
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This device supports DS18S20 and DS18B20 1-Wire sensors on 3 independent 1-Wire
busses.

The busses are scanned for sensors and powerup and therefore the device has to 
be restarted when new sensors are attached. Data then is collected as often as
possible and send out via CAN.

The device sends a extended CAN message with ID 0x20a0, the length is 8 bytes.
The first 6 bytes are the relevant parts of the 1-Wire ID (no family code, no
CRC), the last 2 bytes are the temperature, transmitted as a signed two's
complement number with 6 (binary) fractional digits and thus has to be devided
by 64.

The CAN bitrate is set to 125kBit/s.


You may need to recompile the libcan.a file.
